            "A cataract is a clouding of the lens in the eye which leads to a decrease in vision." +
                    " Cataracts often develop slowly and can affect one or both eyes. Symptoms may include faded colors, " +
                    "blurry vision, halos around light, trouble with bright lights, and trouble seeing at night." +
                    " This may result in trouble driving, reading, or recognizing faces." +
                    " Poor vision caused by cataracts may also result in an increased risk " +
                    "of falling and depression. Cataracts cause half of all cases of blindness and 33% of visual impairment worldwide." +
                    "Cataracts are most commonly due to aging but may also occur due to trauma or radiation exposure, be present from birth, or occur following eye surgery for other problems." +
                    " Risk factors include diabetes, smoking tobacco, prolonged exposure to sunlight, and alcohol." +
                    " The underlying mechanism involves accumulation of clumps of protein or yellow-brown pigment in the lens that reduces transmission of light to the retina at the back of the eye." +
                    " Diagnosis is by an eye examination.\n" +
